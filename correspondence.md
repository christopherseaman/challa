Hi Christopher,

I hope your week is going well. Before our meeting tomorrow, I wanted to ask if there was any additional context that would be helpful for me to provide. One thing I did think of was that for the power calculation for the dyadic actor-partner interdependence  analysis, I realized I should have been using a specific dyadic power calculation program like [APIMPower](https://robert-a-ackerman.shinyapps.io/APIMPowerRdis/). I have played around with it but am not sure if I'm using it correctly. Let me know if any other detail would be helpful.

Thanks!

Sneha

Hi Christopher,

Thank you so much for your response! I'm pretty flexible on Friday – would 12pm work for you?

I have attached the Specific Aims page for my original submission. Aims 1 and 3 are implicated in the power calculations I could use help with. Below is the original text re: power calculations I provided in the application. However, I was really winging it here and after review, don't believe these are correct given my assumptions. Please let me know if I can provide any further context before we meet.

Thanks,

Sneha

**Original Text from Application**

_Power._ For the Aim 1 secondary analysis, 2018-2022 CHIS data include 237 South Asians aged 18–29 years. I have calculated that I will have **80%** power to detect a 15.5% difference in the proportion of IPV experienced by South Asians compared to other racial and ethnic groups at a significance level (alpha) of 0.1, assuming the following: (**1**) approximately 12% of the California population identify as South Asian;24 (**2**) South Asian populations experience higher rates of past-year IPV than other racial and ethnic groups; and (**3**) approximately 6% of non-South Asian individuals in California have experienced past-year IPV.88 Aim 3 is primarily exploratory in nature. According to my power calculation, 200 couples will provide 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.8 for the relationship between scores on measures of gender norms and past-year experiences of IPV (yes/no) at a significance level (alpha) of 0.1, if at least one partner has experienced past-year IPV in 10% of couples. I based power calculations on the IPV outcome because it is likely the most infrequently experienced outcome; therefore, I will be powered to detect smaller effects in other outcomes.

## 2025-05-25: Project Description

PROJECT DESCRIPTION, GOAL, & TIMELINE: I am preparing a K01 resubmission to NICHD focused on understanding the sociocultural influences on sexual and reproductive health among South Asians in the United States. I have two quantitative aims for which I require assistance with power calculations. One aim includes secondary analysis of California Health Interview Survey data to conduct a decomposition analysis to assess differences (and the contributors to the differences) in sexual and reproductive health outcomes between South Asians and other racial/ethnic groups. For this aim I have the pooled unweighted sample of South Asians in the CHIS dataset from 2018-2022 (n=237).
The second aim is a dyadic analysis including N=400 couples in which I have proposed analysis using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Framework.
