## Key Consultation Priorities

1. **Clarify primary outcomes and hypotheses** for both aims
2. **Reality-check feasibility** of proposed sample sizes
3. **Provide appropriate power calculations** using correct methods for each analysis type
4. **Address the α = 0.1 issue** and multiple comparisons
5. **Ensure power calculations align** with K01 review criteria

## Research Context

### Project Overview

This K01 resubmission to NICHD examines sociocultural influences on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) among South Asians in the United States. The study addresses a critical gap in understanding how cultural factors affect intimate partner violence (IPV) and other SRH outcomes in this population.

### Population of Interest

- **South Asians**: Individuals with origins in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and Maldives
- **Age range**: 18-29 years (young adults)
- **Geographic scope**: California (using CHIS data)

### Key Outcomes

- Intimate partner violence (IPV) - past year prevalence
- Other sexual and reproductive health outcomes (not specified in emails)
- Gender norms and their association with these outcomes

## Technical Context

### Decomposition Analysis

Decomposition analysis quantifies how much of an outcome gap between groups is attributable to differences in observable characteristics versus unexplained factors.

**Technical details for power calculations:**
- Effect sizes are expressed as percentage points of the gap explained
- Power depends on: total sample size, group proportions, outcome variance, and number of covariates
- Complex survey designs reduce effective sample size by design effect (typically 1.5-2.0 for CHIS)
- Standard errors must account for clustering and stratification

**Common methods:**
- **Oaxaca-Blinder**: For continuous outcomes; requires ~200+ per group for stable estimates
- **Fairlie**: For binary outcomes; more demanding due to nonlinearity
- **Kitagawa**: For comparing rates between populations

### Dyadic Analysis & Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM)

APIM simultaneously models interdependent outcomes within couples while estimating:

- **Actor effects**: X₁ → Y₁ (own predictor → own outcome)
- **Partner effects**: X₁ → Y₂ (own predictor → partner's outcome)

**Critical power parameters:**
- **ICC (Intraclass Correlation)**: Similarity between partners' outcomes (typically 0.3-0.5 for couples)
- **Actor-partner correlation**: How predictors correlate across partners
- **Effect size ratio**: Partner effects often 30-50% the size of actor effects
- **Distinguishability**: Whether dyad members have distinct roles (e.g., gender in heterosexual couples)

**Power calculation complexity:**
- Standard formulas fail due to non-independence
- Requires simulation or specialized software (APIMPower)
- Sample size needs increase dramatically for detecting partner effects
- 200 couples typically provides 80% power for medium actor effects but only small partner effects

## Aim 1: Secondary Analysis of California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) Data

> **Consultation Need**: Power calculation for decomposition analysis comparing SRH outcomes between South Asians (n=237) and other racial/ethnic groups using pooled 2018-2022 CHIS data.

### Study Design Questions

1. **Which specific decomposition method** are you planning to use?
    1. ==fairlie==
2. **What are ALL the primary outcomes** you'll examine beyond IPV?
    1. ==categorical== - IPV (lowest preval), contraceptive use, contraceptive counseling
3. **Is the sample size truly fixed** at 237 South Asians, or could you add more years of CHIS data?
4. **What's your justification for α = 0.1** instead of the conventional 0.05?
5. **How will you handle multiple comparisons** across outcomes?

### Required Power Calculation Parameters

- **Sample sizes**: ==n=237== for South Asians and each comparison group
- **Outcome type**: ==Binary== or continuous
- **Baseline outcome rates/means** for each group. least prevalent: ==IPV 6%==
- **Effect size of interest**: Minimum meaningful difference to detect ==possibly OR=1.15==
- **Alpha level**: Significance threshold ==α = 0.1==
- **Multiple comparisons:** ==FDR==
- **Number of covariates** in decomposition model ==unadjusted (0)==

**Actor Effects (Own characteristics → Own outcomes):**

1. "What's the typical prevalence difference in [outcome] between South Asians with/without [exposure] in previous studies?" ==estimated at 10% for South Asian given white prevalence at 6%==
2. "What magnitude of association (OR or %) would be clinically meaningful for policy/intervention?" ==OR = 1.15==

**Partner Effects**
1. ==Majority impact coming from partner for IPV, due to the nature of the outcome (violence perpetrated by partner)==

**APIM-Specific**
1. Do you expect bidirectional effects (both partners influence each other)? ==yes, have seen in other populations==
2. Should we test for interaction between actor and partner effects? ==yes, the combination gender norm scores could have different IPV risk than based on independent effects==
3. Any dyad-level variables (shared household factors) to consider? ==initially unadjusted==

### Optional Parameters

- **Design effect** from CHIS ==(if not using default 1.5)==
- **ICC** for clustered observations ==unadjusted for now==
- **Specific comparison groups** (if not all racial/ethnic groups). ==powered on south asians (12%) vs remaining==

### How to Address This Task

1. **Collect all required parameters** from PI
2. **Select appropriate power calculation method** based on decomposition type and outcome
3. **Account for survey design** in effective sample size calculations
4. **Calculate power** for primary outcome with lowest prevalence/smallest effect
5. **Provide sensitivity analyses** varying key assumptions
6. **Consider study design alternatives** if underpowered
7. **Document approach clearly** for grant reviewers

### Current Issues

**Problematic assumptions in original calculation:**
- Claims 12% of California population is South Asian (actual is ~2%)
- Uses α = 0.1 without clear justification
- Only calculates power for secondary outcome (IPV) not primary outcomes
- Doesn't account for complex survey design of CHIS

### Technical Considerations

#### Effective Sample Size with Survey Weights

- CHIS uses complex stratified sampling where some groups are oversampled
- Survey weights adjust for this but increase variance of estimates
- Design effect (DEFF) quantifies this variance inflation: DEFF = Var(weighted)/Var(unweighted)
- Effective sample size = Actual sample size / DEFF
- Example: 237 South Asians with DEFF=1.5 → Effective n = 237/1.5 = 158

**Why This Matters:**
- Power calculations assume simple random sampling
- Using actual n (237) overestimates power
- Must use effective n (158) for accurate power estimates
- DEFF varies by outcome and subgroup (range 1.2-2.0 for CHIS)

#### Decomposition Stability Requirements

**Sample Size per Covariate:**
- General rule: Need 30+ observations per covariate for stable decomposition estimates
- With 237 South Asians (158 effective), maximum ~5-7 covariates
- Each additional covariate reduces degrees of freedom and precision
- Overfitting leads to unstable decomposition components

**Practical Implications:**
- Must prioritize key covariates (age, education, income, etc.)
- Consider grouping related variables (e.g., SES index)
- May need to run reduced models for rare outcomes
- Bootstrap confidence intervals can help assess stability

#### Precision vs. Power in Decomposition

**Overall Test vs. Components:**
- Power calculations typically focus on overall group difference
- Decomposition breaks this into "explained" and "unexplained" portions
- Each component has its own standard error
- Components can have wide CIs even when overall test is significant

**Example Scenario:**
- Overall difference: 10 percentage points (p < 0.05)
- Explained by education: 3 ± 4 percentage points
- Explained by income: 2 ± 3 percentage points
- Unexplained: 5 ± 5 percentage points
- Individual components not statistically significant despite overall significance

**Implications for Grant:**
- Set realistic expectations about component precision
- Focus hypotheses on overall patterns, not specific components
- Consider pooling related characteristics

#### Multiple Comparisons Adjustment

**False Discovery Rate (FDR) vs. Bonferroni:**
- Bonferroni (α/k) is overly conservative for correlated outcomes
- FDR controls expected proportion of false positives
- More appropriate for exploratory analyses with multiple outcomes

**Example with 5 outcomes:**
- Bonferroni: α = 0.05/5 = 0.01 per test
- FDR at 0.05: Allows ~5% false positives among significant results
- Power loss: Bonferroni reduces power by ~30-40%; FDR by ~10-15%

**Recommendations:**
- Pre-specify primary outcome for main power calculation
- Use FDR for secondary/exploratory outcomes
- Consider hierarchical testing procedures

## Aim 3: Dyadic Analysis of Couples

> **Consultation Need**: Power calculation for Actor-Partner Interdependence Model analysis examining associations between gender norms and IPV in 200-400 South Asian couples.

### Study Design Questions

1. **What is the confirmed sample size**: ==200== or 400 couples?
2. **How will gender norms be measured** (validated scale, score range)? ==continuous scale (assume validated) from 1-5==
3. **What are your specific hypotheses** about actor vs partner effects?
4. **Is this cross-sectional or longitudinal** data collection?

### Required Power Calculation Parameters

- **Number of dyads** (couples) ==200==
- **Dyad type**: ==Distinguishable== or indistinguishable
- **Exposure type:** ==continuous scale (assume validated)==
- **Outcome type**: ==Binary (IPV yes/no)== or continuous
- **Actor effect size**: Expected association between own gender norms → own IPV
- **Partner effect size**: Expected association between own gender norms → partner's IPV
- **Alpha level** and number of tails (one or two)

### Optional Parameters (but Highly influential)

- **Correlation between partners' gender norms** (default ~0.4)
- **Correlation between partners' IPV outcomes** (ICC, default ~0.3)
- **IPV base rate** in population
- **Covariates** to be included

### How to Address This Task

1. **Collect all required parameters** from PI
2. **Determine if standard APIM or need extensions** (e.g., for binary outcomes)
3. **Use appropriate software** (APIMPower for continuous, simulation for binary)
4. **Calculate power separately** for actor and partner effects
5. **Create power curves** showing sensitivity to key assumptions
6. **Consider design modifications** if partner effects underpowered
7. **Prepare clear documentation** of assumptions and limitations

### Current Issues

**Original calculation problems:**
- Assumes 10% IPV prevalence (literature suggests 15-30% in South Asian couples)
- OR of 1.8 may be optimistic for gender norms → IPV
- Treats as simple logistic regression, ignoring interdependence
- "Primarily exploratory" framing weakens K01 application

### Technical Considerations

#### Why Interdependence Matters for Power

**Effective Information Reduction:**
- Independent data: 200 couples = 400 independent observations
- Dyadic data: Partners' outcomes are correlated (ICC)
- Effective information = n × [1 + (k-1) × ICC]⁻¹ where k = dyad size (2)
- Example calculations:
  - ICC = 0.3: Effective info = 400 × 0.77 = 308 observations
  - ICC = 0.5: Effective info = 400 × 0.67 = 268 observations
  - ICC = 0.7: Effective info = 400 × 0.59 = 236 observations

**Practical Impact:**
- Higher partner similarity (ICC) → less unique information → lower power
- Can't simply double sample size for couples
- Must account for this in all power calculations

#### Actor Vs Partner Effect Power Differential

**Typical Effect Size Patterns:**
- Actor effects: Direct influence of own characteristics on own outcomes
  - Usually stronger (r = 0.20-0.40)
  - More theoretically expected
  - Easier to detect statistically
- Partner effects: Crossover influence on partner's outcomes
  - Usually weaker (r = 0.10-0.25)
  - May be mediated through relationship dynamics
  - Require larger samples for detection

**Sample Size Implications:**
- For 80% power at α = 0.05:
  - Actor effect (r = 0.30): ~85 couples
  - Actor effect (r = 0.20): ~195 couples
  - Partner effect (r = 0.15): ~350 couples
  - Partner effect (r = 0.10): ~785 couples

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Consider powering for actor effects as primary
- Frame partner effects as exploratory/secondary
- Report detectable effect sizes for given sample

#### Binary Outcome Complications for APIM

**Why IPV as Binary Outcome is Challenging:**
- Logistic APIM more complex than linear APIM
- Effect sizes on odds ratio scale less intuitive
- Variance depends on base rate (maximum at 50%)
- Low base rates (10-20%) reduce power substantially

**Power Calculation Approaches:**
1. **Convert to linear approximation**: Use tetrachoric correlations
2. **Simulation-based**: Most accurate but computationally intensive
3. **GEE-based approximations**: Account for clustering
4. **Rule of thumb**: Need 40-50% more couples than continuous outcome

**Base Rate Effects:**
- 10% IPV rate: Very low power for partner effects
- 20% IPV rate: Moderate power for actor, low for partner
- 30% IPV rate: Good power for actor, moderate for partner

#### Distinguishability and Power

**Distinguishable Dyads (e.g., heterosexual couples):**
- Can estimate gender-specific effects
- Four effects: Male actor, male partner, female actor, female partner
- More parameters but also more theoretical precision
- Allows testing gender differences in effects

**Power Advantages:**
- Can detect gender-specific patterns
- Reduces error variance by accounting for role differences
- Particularly useful if effects differ by gender

**Power Calculation Implications:**
- With 200 distinguishable couples:
  - Well-powered for gender-specific actor effects
  - Underpowered for gender-specific partner effects
  - Can test whether effects differ by gender

#### Realistic Power Expectations with Sample Sizes

**With 200 Couples:**
- **Continuous outcome** (e.g., relationship satisfaction scale):
  - Actor effects (r ≥ 0.20): 80-85% power
  - Partner effects (r ≥ 0.15): 50-60% power
  - Partner effects (r ≥ 0.20): 70-80% power
- **Binary outcome** (20% IPV base rate):
  - Actor effects (OR ≥ 1.8): 70-75% power
  - Partner effects (OR ≥ 1.6): 40-50% power
  - Need OR > 2.0 for good partner effect power

**With 400 Couples:**
- **Continuous outcome**:
  - Actor effects (r ≥ 0.15): 85-90% power
  - Partner effects (r ≥ 0.10): 60-70% power
  - Can detect smaller effects reliably
- **Binary outcome** (20% IPV base rate):
  - Actor effects (OR ≥ 1.5): 80-85% power
  - Partner effects (OR ≥ 1.4): 65-75% power
  - Adequate for most anticipated effects

**Recommendations Based on Sample Size:**
- 200 couples: Focus on actor effects, large partner effects only
- 300 couples: Can reliably detect moderate partner effects
- 400 couples: Well-powered for full APIM with binary outcomes
