The task is to determine the levels of power available to detect the actor and partner effects for an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model analysis with distinguishable dyads given a particular sample size and alpha.

Alpha is set to .100. N refers to the number of dyads. There are 200 dyads (and 0 Person 1 singles and 0 Person 2 singles).

The measure of effect size is Cohen's d. The X variable is assumed to be a dichotomy. The proportion of Person 1 subjects in Category 1 of the X variable is 0.5, and the proportion of Person 2 subjects in Category 1 of the X variable is 0.5. The correlation between the two members' scores on X is .300, and the correlation of the errors is .300. The term "ncp" is the non-centrality parameter or the regression coefficient divided by its standard error.

There is .346 power to detect an actor effect for Person 1 of size .186 (i.e., a beta of .092 or a partial r of .089).

There is .346 power to detect an actor effect for Person 2 of size .186 (i.e., a beta of .092 or a partial r of .089).

There is .538 power to detect a partner effect for Person 1 of size .260 (i.e., a beta of .128 or a partial r of .123).

There is .538 power to detect a partner effect for Person 2 of size .260 (i.e., a beta of .128 or a partial r of .123).

There is .100 power to detect a difference between the Person 1 and Person 2 actor effects of size .000.

There is .100 power to detect a difference between the Person 1 and Person 2 partner effects of size .000.

There is .519 power to detect average of the Person 1 and Person 2 actor effects of size .186.

There is .764 power to detect average of the Person 1 and Person 2 partner effects of size .260.
