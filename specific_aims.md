**SPECIFIC AIMS**

Approximately 24 million people of Asian origin reside in the US,1 including over 5 million who trace their roots to the South Asian countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.2 However, research on sexual and reproductive health (**SRH**) neglects these groups entirely or obscures them by combining them with other Asian subgroups. Among South Asians in their home countries,3–7 the UK,8,9 and Canada,10–13 research shows that gender norms and socio-sexual taboos contribute to limited SRH knowledge and stigma around sex and contraceptive use. Despite a growing South Asian population (3.5 million in 2010 to 5.4 million in 2017), these patterns have not yet been widely investigated in the US. Limited research indicates that gender-based violence, including physical and sexual intimate partner violence (**IPV**), among South Asian populations in the US is largely driven by the same normative influences that perpetuate adverse SRH outcomes among South Asians elsewhere.14–19 However, there is little consideration for how gender-based power imbalances and their sequelae fit in the SRH ecosystem of the US.20–22 **This study will be among the first comprehensive investigations of SRH service use, contraceptive use, and IPV among South Asians, one of the fastest-growing racially minoritized groups in the US.**

Studies in South Asia demonstrate that gender norms drive undesired fertility outcomes (e.g., unintended pregnancy),4 poor access to health services,23 and limited contraceptive decision-making power among women.5 When people migrate, the norms and attitudes of their home countries toward relationships and sex24 may conflict with those in their destination countries.25–27 Because, gender roles are socialized at early ages in South Asian families,28 people who immigrate at young ages (1.5 generation) or are born to immigrant parents (second-generation) bear the brunt of this cultural dissonance. This becomes especially salient when they begin to enact gender norms and engage in SRH behaviors in early sexual relationships. Thus, **understanding how gender-based power dynamics contribute to SRH behaviors among young South Asians necessitates a focus on the relationship context through dyadic perspectives from couples.**

As the racial and ethnic composition of the US shifts, so does its sociocultural makeup, which can make fostering a normative context that enables all people to pursue healthy sexual relationships and positive SRH outcomes challenging. My long-term goal is to establish an independent research career using individual and dyadic approaches to investigate the normative- and relationship-level factors that influence SRH among racially minoritized young people. This K01 focuses on South Asian populations to: (**1**) test the hypothesis that differences in SRH outcomes exist between young South Asians and other racial and ethnic groups in the US and (**2**) generate hypotheses regarding the underlying normative and relationship factors that influence SRH. Supported by training in how to apply demographic theories of fertility and migration, mixed-methods research techniques, and dyadic research with couples, I will achieve the following aims:

**Aim 1: Quantitatively examine the social**[[A1]](#_msocom_1)  **and access-related drivers of SRH among young South Asian populations in California.** Using California Health Interview Survey data from men and women aged 18–29 years, I will (_1a_) examine SRH disparities (receipt of contraceptive counseling, contraceptive use, and experiences of sexual violence) between South Asians and other racial and ethnic groups and assess the roles played by immigration factors (years in the US, citizenship status, and generational cohort[[A2]](#_msocom_2) [[A3]](#_msocom_3) ); and (_1b_) investigate the relationships of access-related factors (usual source of care, access to care, and health insurance status) with SRH outcomes among South Asian men and women.

**Aim 2: Conduct a qualitative dyadic exploration of the intersection of gender norms and SRH among young South Asians in heterosexual relationships and their partners.** I will use social media to recruit N=20 heterosexual couples (N=40 individuals) ages 18-29 years in which at least one partner identifies as South Asian to participate in a qualitative study of social norms, relationship dynamics, and SRH.

**Aim 3: Quantitatively examine the relationship and normative factors that influence SRH among young South Asian in heterosexual relationships and their partners**. I will use social media to recruit N=200 heterosexual couples (N=400 individuals) ages 18-29 years in which at least one partner identifies as South Asian. Couple members will each complete a survey on perceptions and experiences of social norms, relationship dynamics, and SRH outcomes (based on Aims 1 and 2 findings). Analyses will test dyadic associations of perceived gender norms and relationship power with SRH outcomes.

Completion of this project will generate preliminary data regarding the normative and relationship factors that influence SRH outcomes among a key demographic in the US: South Asians. Findings will support an R01 proposal to develop and test a dyadic intervention that supports gender-equitable relationships and positive SRH outcomes for young South Asians and their partners. The proposed research will contribute to a robust research agenda, program development, and policy advocacy. By focusing on addressing cultural dissonance, results will have broad implications for improving SRH outcomes among young first- and second-generation immigrants as they navigate gender roles and SRH behaviors in the context of early relationships.
